# Release Notes: v0.2.2

**Release Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Recommended for all users

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 0.2.2 is a critical bug fix release that resolves a double-encryption issue and completes the API V2 migration started in v0.2.1.

This release fixes all issues preventing email delivery and makes the plugin fully compatible with the EnjinMel REST API V2 specification.

---

## 🔥 Critical Fixes

### 1. Double-Encryption Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** API keys could become corrupted (double-encrypted) when settings were saved multiple times, causing authentication failures.

**Impact:** 
- API returns "401 Unauthorized" 
- All email sends fail
- Users see "Unknown error" or "Request failed" messages

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added detection to prevent re-encryption of already encrypted values
- ✅ Automatic repair of existing corrupted keys on plugin load
- ✅ One-time migration runs transparently
- ✅ No user action required

**Technical Details:**
The bug occurred when an encrypted API key (starting with `v2:`) was re-submitted without the masking asterisks. The code would encrypt it again, creating a double-encrypted value that couldn't be properly decrypted.

### 2. API V2 Compatibility (from v0.2.1)
**Problem:** Plugin was sending fields not supported by EnjinMel V2 API, causing 500 Internal Server Errors.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed `SubmittedContentType` field (not in V2 spec)
- ✅ Removed `IsHtmlContent` field (not in V2 spec)
- ✅ Removed `ReplyToEmail` field (not documented in V2 spec)
- ✅ Made `SenderName` optional (only sent when not empty)
- ✅ Added default values for empty subject and message fields
